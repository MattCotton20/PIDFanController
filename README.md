## PID Fan Controller

#### Description:

This software control system provides a user with methods of controlling a variable-speed DC fan via an FPGA.
- The controller drives the fan using a PWM signal, and measures its speed via its tachometer signal.
- Open-loop or closed-loop PID feedback control can be toggled between via a switch.
- The target speed / duty cycle can be adjusted via a rotary encoder.
- System parameters (e.g. fan speed, controller error) are displayed on a set of seven-segment displays, and toggled between using push buttons.

This is my code submission for EE30186 coursework: Fan Controller. EE30186 is the Integrated Engineering module in the Department of Electronic & Electrical Engineering at the University of Bath.

#### Installation & Usage:

This code requires additional resources (such as "EE30186.h") to compile. As these files are property of the University of Bath, their inclusion in this GitHub upload has been excluded. Therefore, the purpose of this upload is solely to illustrate the controller code.
